Uses the Glut and Math library in C to create Doom Clone engine.

I followed a Doom Clone tutorial created by 3DSage on YouTube httpswww.youtube.comwatchv=huMO4VQEwPc&t=468s

Includes texturing capability which I am currently debugging and fixing on my own.
Glut Library must be downloaded separately.
